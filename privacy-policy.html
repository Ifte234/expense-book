    <h1>Privacy Policy for Expense Book</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: June 11, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Expense Book is a transaction management application designed to help you manage customer transactions, personal finances, trips, and a cashbook. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We collect your email address or phone number during registration for account verification and recovery. You may also provide email addresses or phone numbers of customers or trip members to enable sharing and communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> The app records transaction amounts, descriptions, dates, and attached receipt images for your records.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> With your permission, we access your device’s contacts to add customers or trip members, your camera to capture receipt photos, and your storage to save and access receipt images.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data on how you interact with the app to enhance our services and improve your experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To deliver core functionalities, including managing transactions, generating reports, and backing up data to the cloud.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you via notifications about updates or through in-app chat for support and customer interactions.</li>
        <li>To display personalized advertisements via Google AdMob.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device and securely backed up to cloud servers using Firebase, a Google service. We use industry-standard encryption and secure authentication for data in transit and at rest. Receipt images and backups are only accessible to your authenticated account. You can restore your data on a new device after verifying your account with an OTP.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with third parties, except for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud service providers, such as Firebase, for secure data backup.</li>
        <li>AdMob, strictly for showing ads (no personal data is shared).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We never sell your data or provide information to advertisers or marketing partners. You may share transaction data with customers through the app. Shared data is view-only, and recipients cannot edit or delete it. Once shared, Expense Book is not responsible for how recipients use that data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your data as long as your account exists. You can edit or delete any transaction, customer profile, trip, or cashbook entry anytime within the app. To delete your entire account and data, please go to <strong>Settings &gt; Delete Account</strong>, and all your data will be permanently removed.</p>

    <h2>User Rights & Control</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, export, or delete your personal data.</li>
        <li>Control permissions (e.g., camera, storage, contacts) through your device settings.</li>
        <li>Opt out of notifications or cloud backups at any time from Settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may also opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings or following Google’s instructions. If you wish to exercise these rights or have privacy questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@expensebook.app">support@expensebook.app</a>.</p>
